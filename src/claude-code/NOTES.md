> **⚠️ macOS hosts are not supported.** Claude Code on macOS stores OAuth tokens in the system Keychain, not in a file under `~/.claude/`. This Feature reads credentials via a read-only bind mount of `~/.claude/.credentials.json` — which simply does not exist on a macOS host. Use a Linux host, a Windows host with Claude Code installed natively, or WSL2 (with Claude Code installed inside the WSL distribution).

## Architecture

```
Image-Build (install.sh, as root):
    jq + curl + sudo installed
    Claude Code binary cached at /opt/claude-code/cache/claude  (SHA-256 verified)
    Lifecycle scripts installed to /usr/local/share/claude-code/

Container lifecycle:
    onCreate   ── `claude install <channel>` as target user
               ── → ~/.local/bin/claude  +  ~/.local/share/claude/versions/<v>/
               ── (prebuild-cacheable: result is baked into the prebuild image)

    postCreate ── credentials + minimal .claude.json from host bind mount
               ── wizard-state fields (theme, firstStartTime, tipsHistory, …)
                  carried forward so first `claude` invocation skips onboarding
               ── marketplace add → plugin install (in that order)

    postStart  ── token refresh (if host has newer `expiresAt`)
               ── workspace trust + remoteDialogSeen in ~/.claude.json
               ── idempotent wizard-state nachziehen (handles host re-login
                  or older Feature versions that did not write theme)
               ── permissions.defaultMode + remoteControlAtStartup +
                  skipAutoPermissionPrompt / skipDangerousModePermissionPrompt
                  in ~/.claude/settings.json
               ── useHostStatusbar: mirror host statusLine into settings.json
                  + symlink referenced ~/.claude/ scripts from the host mount
               ── optional: spawn `claude remote-control --spawn worktree` daemon
```

## Host requirements

The Feature declares these bind mounts:

```
${localEnv:HOME}${localEnv:USERPROFILE}/.claude.json  →  /host_claude/.claude.json
${localEnv:HOME}${localEnv:USERPROFILE}/.claude       →  /host_claude/.claude
```

The `${localEnv:HOME}${localEnv:USERPROFILE}` concatenation resolves to the user's home on Linux/macOS (where only `HOME` is set) and on Windows (where only `USERPROFILE` is set), per [VS Code's recommended cross-platform mount pattern](https://code.visualstudio.com/remote/advancedcontainers/add-local-file-mount).

For the bind mounts to resolve, the host user must have **logged into Claude Code at least once** on the host machine, so that the source paths exist.

### Windows hosts: use Remote-WSL

If your host is Windows and Claude Code is installed inside a WSL2 distro (the typical setup — Claude Code does not run natively on Windows), do **not** open the project with VS Code on Windows directly. The substitution above would resolve to `C:\Users\<you>\.claude.json`, which is empty. Instead:

1. Install the [WSL extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-wsl) in VS Code.
2. From Windows: `wsl` into your distro, `cd` to the project, run `code .` — VS Code reopens connected to WSL.
3. *Reopen in Container* from there.

In that mode `${localEnv:HOME}` is `/home/<wsl-user>` (the WSL home where Claude Code actually lives), Docker Desktop's WSL2 backend handles bind mounts as native Linux paths, and no additional host-side configuration is required. Features cannot run host-side scripts, so Windows-side symlink automation isn't possible from this Feature — Remote-WSL is the zero-config path.

> **Mount mode is read-write at the OS level.** The `devContainerFeature.schema.json` for Feature manifests only accepts `{source, target, type}` Mount objects with `additionalProperties: false` — no `readonly` flag — so we cannot declare these mounts read-only from the Feature itself. The Feature's lifecycle scripts (`postCreate.sh`, `postStart.sh`) only ever *read* from `/host_claude/...`; they never write back. If you want a hard guarantee, override the mount in your own `devcontainer.json` with the docker-cli string form: `"source=...,target=/host_claude/...,type=bind,readonly"`.

### Platform-specific behavior

| Host | Where Claude Code stores credentials | Works? |
|---|---|---|
| Linux | `~/.claude.json` + `~/.claude/.credentials.json` | ✅ |
| VS Code in Remote-WSL with Claude installed in the WSL distro | `~/.claude.json` in the WSL distro (`${localEnv:HOME}` = `/home/<wsl-user>`) | ✅ Recommended Windows path — see above |
| VS Code on Windows + Claude in WSL2 distro | `~/.claude.json` in the WSL distro — **not** under `%USERPROFILE%` | ❌ Use Remote-WSL instead (the Feature cannot automate Windows-side symlinks from inside the container) |
| VS Code on Windows + Claude installed natively on Windows | `%USERPROFILE%\.claude.json` + `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\` | ✅ Uncommon (Claude Code is not officially distributed for native Windows) |
| macOS | OAuth tokens stored in **Keychain**, not in `~/.claude/` | ❌ Not supported by this Feature |
| VS Code "Clone in Container Volume" on Windows | Source paths might not exist on the host filesystem | ❌ See [devcontainers/spec#335](https://github.com/devcontainers/spec/issues/335) |

## How edge cases are handled

| Scenario | Behavior |
|---|---|
| No host credentials present | `postCreate` soft-fails (`exit 0`); the container is still usable, Claude prompts for login on first invocation. |
| Workspace is not a git repo | `remoteControlServer` is skipped with a warning (—`spawn worktree` requires git). |
| Target user differs between image build and runtime | Auto-detect runs on every lifecycle hook; no hardcoded UID. |
| Re-run on persistent volume | `claude install` skipped if `~/.local/bin/claude` already exists. Token refresh only writes when host `expiresAt` is strictly greater than container's. |
| Host account switched (different `userID`) | `postStart` merges the new account fields into the existing `.claude.json` without losing workspace trust + remote-control settings. |
| Workspace trust dialog | `postStart` writes `hasTrustDialogAccepted=true` + `hasCompletedProjectOnboarding=true` under `.projects[<path>]` for every immediate subdir of `/workspaces` — Claude checks trust per exact-path against the cwd, so the `/workspaces` parent itself is intentionally **not** added (would be a dead entry), and every repo opened from `/workspaces/*` stays trusted. |
| Concurrent reads during token refresh | `postStart.sh` writes (credential refresh, `.claude.json` patch, `settings.json` patch) go through a `mktemp` + atomic `mv` helper on the same filesystem. The initial install in `postCreate.sh` uses plain `cp` / shell redirects after the host mount has been validated. |
| Host status-line script | With `useHostStatusbar=true`, `postStart` mirrors the host's `settings.json` `statusLine` into the container and symlinks any `~/.claude/`-scoped script from the read-only mount, so the unchanged command runs. Strict mirror: `false` or a host without `statusLine` removes the key. Only `~/.claude/` paths are linked — absolute host-home paths are not resolved. A pre-existing regular file at the link target is never overwritten. |

## Configuration option notes

**`channel`** — defaults to empty so the host's chosen update channel wins. `claude install <channel>` on the host persists `autoUpdatesChannel: "stable"|"latest"` to `~/.claude/settings.json`; `onCreate.sh` reads that field via the bind mount (`/host_claude/.claude/settings.json`) and passes it to `claude install <channel>` inside the container. Fallback is `latest` when (a) the host setting is absent, (b) jq is unavailable, or (c) the bind mount is missing (typically Codespaces prebuilds). Setting the option explicitly always wins.

**`defaultMode`** — defaults to empty so the value the host wizard wrote (if any) survives into the container. Set explicitly to override. Notable values: `"auto"` is Anthropic's ML-classifier permission mode (requires Claude Code ≥ 2.1.83 and a Pro/Max/Team/Enterprise account; the first cycle into auto mode per account otherwise shows a one-time opt-in dialog — this Feature pre-accepts it by writing `skipAutoPermissionPrompt=true` alongside `permissions.defaultMode="auto"` into `~/.claude/settings.json`). For `defaultMode = "bypassPermissions"` the analogue `skipDangerousModePermissionPrompt=true` is written.

**`remoteControl`** vs. **`remoteControlServer`** — these are independent:
- `remoteControl=true` writes `remoteControlAtStartup=true` to `~/.claude/settings.json` (this is where Claude Code ≥ 2.1.83 actually reads it from — older docs that point at `~/.claude.json` are out of date) and sets `remoteDialogSeen=true` in `~/.claude.json` to suppress the one-time prompt. Result: every *interactive* `claude` session auto-registers for Remote Control.
- `remoteControlServer=true` spawns a long-running `claude remote-control --spawn worktree` *daemon* in `postStart` even when no user is at the terminal. PID + log at `~/.claude/remote-control.{pid,log}`.

**`marketplaces` / `plugins`** — comma-separated strings (devcontainer Feature options do not support native arrays). Items are trimmed of whitespace; empty items are skipped. Order is preserved. Both are only attempted if the credential setup did not soft-fail.

**Claude Code VS Code extension** (`anthropic.claude-code`) — declared via the manifest's `customizations.vscode.extensions` field, which VS Code Remote / Codespaces / Cursor merges into the effective `devcontainer.json` and installs through the IDE's own marketplace integration on attach. Earlier versions tried to run `<code-cli> --install-extension anthropic.claude-code --force` from `postCreate.sh`, but the VS Code Remote CLI refuses to operate outside a VS Code-managed terminal (no `VSCODE_IPC_HOOK_CLI` socket → `"Command is only available in WSL or inside a Visual Studio Code terminal."`). The declarative path doesn't have that constraint — it runs in the IDE's extension-host process, not as a child of any container lifecycle hook. JetBrains and other non-VS-Code hosts ignore the `customizations.vscode` block, which is the desired behaviour (the extension is VS Code only).

**`forwardHostOnboarding` / `theme`** — suppress the first-run wizard inside the container. A valid login on the host is *not* enough on its own: Claude Code shows the theme picker (and other onboarding dialogs) whenever fields like `theme`, `firstStartTime`, or `tipsHistory` are absent from `~/.claude.json`. With `forwardHostOnboarding=true` (default), `postCreate.sh` copies those wizard-state fields from the host into the container, and `postStart.sh` idempotently nachzieht missing ones on every start (also fixes containers created by older Feature versions that did not write them). `theme` defaults to empty so the host's wizard choice is preserved; set it explicitly to override (useful for matching the IDE's color scheme regardless of what was picked on the host). As a final safety net, if `theme` would still be empty after all merges — host has no `.claude.json`, option not set — `postStart.sh` forces it to `"dark"` so the picker is guaranteed not to appear.

**`claudeMd` / `hostClaudeMerge`** — synthesize `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` (user-level memory loaded by every `claude` session) inside the container from up to two sources, written in this order:

1. `claudeMd` (string, default `""`) — literal markdown injected as the first block. Useful for container-specific instructions you do not want to commit to the host's memory.
2. `hostClaudeMerge` (boolean, default `true`) — when the host's `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` is readable via the bind mount, its content is appended after the `claudeMd` block, separated by a blank line.

Both empty/absent → the Feature does not touch any existing `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` in the container. With `claudeMd=""` and `hostClaudeMerge=true`, the host file is mirrored verbatim into the container. Re-applied on every `postStart` with a diff-check, so identical content is a no-op but **container-side edits to `~/.claude/CLAUDE.md` will be overwritten on the next start whenever the computed body differs** (intentional, analogous to credential refresh). If you want the container's copy to be authoritative once written, set both options to neutralize the helper: `claudeMd=""` and `hostClaudeMerge=false`.

**`useHostStatusbar`** — defaults to `true`. Claude Code's status line lives under `statusLine` in `~/.claude/settings.json` (typically `{ "type": "command", "command": "~/.claude/statusline.sh" }`). When enabled, `postStart.sh` mirrors the host's `statusLine` into the container's `settings.json` and, for any script referenced via `~/.claude/...` or `$HOME/.claude/...`, creates a symlink `~/.claude/<name>` → `/host_claude/.claude/<name>` so the unchanged command resolves against the read-only host mount. The symlink target is the absolute mount path and is recreated idempotently on every `postStart` (self-healing). The behavior is a strict mirror of the host: with `useHostStatusbar=false`, or when the host has no `statusLine`, the key is removed from the container settings. **Scope limitation:** only scripts under `~/.claude/` are linked. A `command` that points at an absolute host-home path (`/home/<hostuser>/.claude/...`), runs `npx`, or is an inline shell snippet is still copied verbatim, but no symlink is created — an absolute host path will not resolve inside the container. A pre-existing regular file at the symlink target is left untouched (only a warning is logged).

## Known upstream issues

- **`remoteControlServer` may fail on Claude Code 2.1.98** — the session-creation API rejects the v2.1.98 payload with HTTP 400 *"Extra inputs are not permitted"* ([anthropics/claude-code#45975](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/45975)). The daemon spawns correctly, but the bridge to claude.ai fails. Awaiting Anthropic fix.
- **`claude install` location is hardcoded** to `~/.local/bin/claude` + `~/.local/share/claude/versions/<v>/` ([anthropics/claude-code#21019](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code/issues/21019)). The Feature intentionally caches its build-time copy under `/opt/claude-code/cache/` to satisfy the "initial download during image build" requirement.
